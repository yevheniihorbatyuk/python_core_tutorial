# Module 2: Control Flow and Functions

Canonical entrypoint for this module.

## What this module is
This module teaches Python fundamentals for beginners and offers an advanced DS/DE-oriented path without splitting the module into competing documentation tracks.

Baseline policy: **Python 3.10-3.12** for mainline learning. Python 3.13 topics are optional notes only.

## Audience
- Beginner path: students with little or no Python background
- Advanced DS/DE path: students with basic Python who need practical data-focused examples

## Learning tracks (single module, two paths)
- Beginner path: see [`docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md`](docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md)
- Advanced DS/DE path: see [`docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md`](docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md)

## Notebook policy
- Primary notebook: [`fundamentals_notebook.ipynb`](fundamentals_notebook.ipynb)
- Legacy/optional notebook: [`notebook.ipynb`](notebook.ipynb)

## Legacy navigation pages
- Modern quick redirect: [`README_MODERN.md`](README_MODERN.md)
- Track chooser: [`COMPARISON.md`](COMPARISON.md)

## Version and scope guardrails
- Mainline examples and expectations target Python 3.10-3.12.
- Do not treat preview language features as required for passing this module.
- Keep docs DRY: update canonical pages instead of duplicating instructions across files.
