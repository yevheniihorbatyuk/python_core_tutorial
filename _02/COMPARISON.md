# Path Chooser: Beginner vs Advanced DS/DE

Use this page only to choose a path. Detailed content is canonicalized elsewhere.

## Choose path
- Beginner path: fundamentals-first, lower abstraction, syntax confidence
- Advanced DS/DE path: data-oriented tasks, practical patterns, stronger typing discipline

## Canonical references
- Path details and outcomes: [`docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md`](docs/LEARNING_PATHS.md)
- File roles and structure: [`docs/CONTENT_MAP.md`](docs/CONTENT_MAP.md)
- Session flow and timing: [`docs/TEACHING_FLOW.md`](docs/TEACHING_FLOW.md)

## Baseline policy
Both paths use **Python 3.10-3.12** as the required baseline.
Python 3.13 preview topics are optional only.
